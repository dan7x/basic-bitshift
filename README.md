# ICS4U_2A : Recursion
Assignment #2A from ICS4U; recursion assignment with needless bit-shifting & code condensing -- semester 2, 2020-21.

Introduction to recursion assignment.
Nothing specifically said that the code ought to be neat and human-readable, so I took this as an opportunity to learn bit-shifting.

Managed to fit the entire class with the recursion logic into 30 lines of code (albeit, messy and unreadable code).
